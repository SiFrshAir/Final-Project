    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <div>Welcome to Blazing Legends, an ecosystem for the youth in Chicago. Throughout this site you can find many different valuable resources. 
    The first being a collection of my stories about my college experience and what steps I had to take after leaving school. 
    This business and its components are all about transparency and I would be remissed as the founder to not uphold that standard
    In addition to that, I will be discussing my journey to becoming a software engineer and the resources that helped me with that transition.</div>

    <h2> My Back Story </h2>
    <div> I am a 28 year old resident of the southside of Chicago,IL. My father unfortunately passed away when I was only 2 years old, and 
        my mother had to raise me and 2 of my sisters who are 29 and 27 on her own which was a tall, but not insurmountable task. 
        As kids, she kept us focused on school, and our after school activities. We all decided to go to college after graduating high school,
        and true to our family tradition we chose HBCUS, mine being Alabama A&M University(Go Bulldogs!), my older sister's North Carolina A&T, 
        and my younger's being Tuskegee University, which is also in Alabama.</div>
    
    
    <div> At AAMU, which is located in Huntsville,AL I studied Psychology with a minor in Political Science, and participated in a few different organizations.
            Those included Phi Beta Lambda Business Fraternity, a social greek club, Psychology club, Leadership Catalyst Institute, Intramurals for basketball, Pre Law Society, etc.
            It was a wonderful opportunity to live in a new environment, meet people from all over, and find out what life would be like for me moving forward. I made some lifelong friends
            and am forever thankful for my journey there. Even through the inevitable tribulations, I was able to stay focused and finish school in 2018.</div>
            
    <div> I was 23 years old at this point, and though I enjoyed the learning curriculum and applied theory for psychology, I wanted to go down a different path.
        The reason for this was I felt more passionate about working with computers and building websites,applications,etc.
        I wanted to focus more on learning and eventually teaching people how computers work. I had been working with them since my freshman year of high school, 
        and would like to thank my instructor Mrs. Sajid for initally sparking my interest in web development. Starting in 2019 I began writing down what would be necessary for 
        me to achieve my goals with this area. I quickly realized that I would need to find a niche/specialty, which I decided to be Full Stack Web Engineering,
        I was able to locate a very useful bootcamp through social media, named 100 Devs, which was started by Leon Noel, an instructor and engineer, based out of Philadelphia,PA 
        The main purpose of this program is to help those who have recently just transitioned to the tech field. He offers an array of modules, activities, support groups/channels, and 
        an overall helping hand with navigating this industry. I would also like to thank him, his peers, and community for their help with my software Engineering.</div>
