        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Blazing Legends, an ecosystem for the youth in Chicago. Throughout this site you can find many different valuable resources. 
        The first being this page, detailing my college experience and the steps I took after finishing school. The biggest core value held within this business is transparency,
        which I developed a lot more in and after college. In order to solve problems, and alleviate tension, it is our belief that you have to show up as your authentic self,
        even on the bad days. In order to move forward you have to understand and accept your past and how much you have been able to grow from it. No one is perfect, and that is ok because to us progress supercedes
        that every time. Enjoy my back story, and the resources I have offered, and there will be more added as time goes on. </p>
        
        <h2> My Back Story </h2>
        <p> I am a 28 year old resident of the southside of Chicago,IL. My father unfortunately passed away when I was only 2 years old, and 
        my mother had to raise me and 2 of my sisters who are 29 and 27 on her own which was a tall, but not insurmountable task. 
        As kids, she kept us focused on school, and our after school activities. We all decided to go to college after graduating high school,
        and true to our family tradition we chose HBCUS, mine being Alabama A&M University(Go Bulldogs!), my older sister's North Carolina A&T, 
        and my younger's being Tuskegee University, which is also in Alabama.</p>
    
    
        <p> At AAMU(Alabama A&M University), located in Huntsville,AL I studied Psychology with a minor in Political Science, and participated in a few different organizations.
            Those included Phi Beta Lambda Business Fraternity, which is a social greek, Psychology club, Leadership Catalyst Institute, Intramurals for basketball, Pre Law Society, etc.
            It was a wonderful opportunity to live in a new environment, meet people from all over, and find out what life would be like for me moving forward. I made some lifelong friends
            and am forever thankful for my journey there. Even through the inevitable tribulations, I was able to stay focused and finish school in 2018.</p>
            
        <p> I was 23 years old at this point, and though I enjoyed the learning curriculum and applied theory for psychology, I wanted to go down a different path.
        The reason for this was I felt more passionate about working with computers and building websites,applications,etc.
        I wanted to focus more on learning and eventually teaching people how computers work, and how to program their components to your liking. I had been working with them since my freshman year of high school, 
        and would like to thank my instructor Mrs. Sajid for initally sparking my interest in web development. Starting in 2019 I began writing down what would be necessary for 
        me to achieve my goals with this area. I quickly realized that I would need to find a niche/specialty, which I decided to be Full Stack Web Engineering,
        I was able to locate a very useful bootcamp through social media, named 100 Devs, which was started by Leon Noel, an instructor and engineer, based out of Philadelphia,PA 
        The main purpose of this program is to help those who have recently just transitioned to the tech field. He offers an array of modules, activities, support groups/channels, and 
        an overall helping hand with navigating this industry. I would like to thank him, his peers, and community for their wonderful resources. 
        Finally I would like to thank Bitwise for their training program which I came across thanks to a recommendation from a Coffee Chat I had with the intention of continuing progress on my journey.
        They have a tremendously helpful community of instructors, and success specialists to help those of us beginning our professional journeys in web development. </p>
   
        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <p> In addition to the help I have had the great luxury of accessing, there are countless more resources that can help you find a new career path, gain more skills, or just more knowledge in general.
            I have detailed a few of these on the resources page, and can also help you find others if you reach out to me via the form on the contact page. Everyone's path is different, and knowing that,
            on of our primary goals is to let you explain what it is you need and how we can best help you find resources to help you achieve that. We are not a job agency, training program, or educational institute.
            We are a Business with an initiave of creating an ecosystem for individuals looking to better themselves and/or the people around them. If you have any questions do not hesitate to reach out at any time.
            We look forward to hearing from you and we encourage you to get better every single day. Progress is always better than perfection. Peace, Love, and Light to you and yours.
            
            Sincerely, Blazing Legends
